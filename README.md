# Sudoku-Solver
Solve sudoku boards with Genetic Programming (GP) technique, GP is a collection of evolutionary computation techniques
that allow computers to solve problems automatically.
Since its inception twenty years ago, GP has been used to solve a wide range of practical problems,
producing a number of human-competitive results and even patentable new inventions.
Like many other areas of computer science, GP is evolving rapidly, with new ideas, techniques and applications 
being constantly proposed. While this shows how wonderfully prolific GP is, it also makes it difficult for newcomers 
to become acquainted with the main ideas in the field, and form a mental map of its different branches.
Even for people who have been interested in GP for a while, it is difficult to keep up with the pace of new developments.
You can read about the topic in depth in 
[A Field Guide to Genetic Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Genetic-Programming/dp/1409200736) book,
or read the full [documentation](https://abdulrhmanil.github.io/Sudoku-Solver/) of the application,

## Sudoku Description
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that 
each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub grids that compose the grid 
(also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. 
The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
Completed games are always a type of Latin square with an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions.
For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in the same row, column,
or any of the nine 3×3 sub regions of the 9x9 playing board.

## Getting Started  
All what you need to run the program is  from the main method in Driver class, and the application will choose a random sudoku 
board from the [realBoards.txt](https://github.com/Abdulrhmanil/Sudoku-Solver/blob/master/boards/realBoards.txt) file.
